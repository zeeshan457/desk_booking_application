# Desk Booking System

A role-based desk booking system designed to manage workspace reservations efficiently within the University of Bradford.  
The application supports multiple user roles, secure access control, and full administrative management of desks, users, and bookings.

This project demonstrates strong foundations in **Java**, **object-oriented design**, **database integration**, and **system-level thinking**, making it suitable for real-world IT and enterprise environments.
